# Strength^N 

## Project Summary

Strength^n is a randomization algorithm that allows an administrator to make combinations from a list of participants. The goal of this project is to create a user interface to allow scheduling with your new combination, visualizing your growing network of meaningful connections, and maybe even texting functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
* Heroku account 
* Svelte install (steps below)



### create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.


## Testing

We use Jest as our testing platform. We have tests for the back-end analyzing the core capibilties of the project. The command "npm run test" will run the tests while "npm test --coverage" will dispaly a detailed coverage report
